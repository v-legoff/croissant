   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Croissant's documentation!
=====================================

Croissant is a library for testing your application using a ubiquitous
language.  If you are new to Behavior-Driven development and
want to know how it works and why adopt it, you should read the
:doc:`bdd`.  If you
already have a good idea of what it is and want to know how to use
croissant itself, you can read the :doc:`tutorial` directly.
